From line 1-3, the program opens, reads and prints the 10 sentences in the file 'Random_File.txt'.

From line 5-8, the program opens a new file called 'Edited_File.txt' and writes a single sentence. Only after doing so will the program inform you that it has been done sucessfully.

From line 10-16, the program will ask you to input a file name. Here, you should enter the file name exactly how it appears. Failiure to do so will result in the popping up of an error message stating 'File not found'. the same negative result will be your output if you insert a file name that does not exist. However, if your file does indeed exist and you have typed in its name correctly then the program will read and print the data in the file.
